            <p>Patrick Yao is a 17-year-old student and musician based in Athens, Greece. He is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, performer and researcher. He has composed music in various genres and styles, with over 30 compositions to date, the most recent being the soundtrack of the film “Beach” by Dimitri Hiroshi Krontiras – a blend of classical and electronic scores. Since 2023, Patrick has been exploring audio recording and music production, having mixed and mastered over 20 projects and performances to date.</p>
            <p>Equally intrigued by computer science, Patrick's work has concentrated on music technology since 2024. His current research interests include applications of AI in music, human-machine interaction, and computer-based sound design. He has also peer reviewed research papers for International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) and Web Audio Conference (WAC). In 2025, he founded the Athens Music Technology Forum (AMTF), which hosted its inaugural conference under the theme of "The Sonic Frontier: AI and the Future of Music" in November 2025 at the Megaro Mousikis (Athens Concert Hall). Patrick’s current research project is focused on the use of gesture control and motion for interactive computer music improvisation.</p>
            <p>Patrick has performed an extensive musical repertoire, whether as a pianist, a chamber and orchestral musician, or as a singer. Music played by Patrick at concerts includes classical music, jazz, rock, R&B, as well as film music. In 2022, under the guidance of internationally distinguished pianist Dimitris Toufexis, he performed at the Circolo Culturale Lirico in Bologna, Italy. In 2023, he performed in a recital held at the Athens Concert Hall.</p>
            <p>In addition, Patrick’s performances have featured collaborations with various musicians, including saxophonist Theo Connolly, and violinist Thea Vasilaki. As a member of his school orchestra since 2021, Patrick has served as the keyboardist (2021-2022), melodica player (2023, 2025-2026), and bassist (2024). Patrick runs an eponymous YouTube Channel, where he periodically uploads his performances, compositions, song covers, and music technology projects.</p>
